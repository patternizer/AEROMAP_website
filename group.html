	  <h2>Abstract</h2>
	  
	  <p class="bodytxt">
The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified that the largest uncertainty in current estimates of planetary radiation forcing is due to 
atmospheric aerosols and has called for an urgent expansion of global studies to monitor and characterise them. Aerosols are characterised by their optical and 
microphysical properties and while the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) of remote sensing instruments provides accurate values for them, AERONET's coverage of the 
Earth surface is sparse (mostly city-based) and patchy. The AEROMAP project is designed to provide a solution to overcome this lack of information on global aerosols 
without the need to invest in hundreds of new AERONET sites. To achieve this, AEROMAP will harness and capitalise on the high resolution full-Earth measurements of 
aerosol optical depth provided daily by satellite remote sensing instruments. Furthermore, by using satellite-driven data, AEROMAP will be able to gain access to 
aerosol characteristics over the oceans which are of paramount importance to the estimate of the overall radiation budget. As a result, the retrieval of aerosol 
optical and microphysical properties by AEROMAP will significantly extend the efforts to globally monitor and characterise atmospheric aerosols.</p>

<p class="bodytxt">
AEROMAP has developed and validated data mining tools based on neural networks to convert satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth and columnar water vapour 
into aerosol optical and microphysical properties like the single scattering albedo, particle asymmetry factor, complex refractive index and the aerosol size 
distribution. This is a very challenging problem as satellite instruments, unlike their ground-based counterparts in AERONET, do not yet have the capability to 
provide polarisation information obtained from the diffuse radiation field.  In essence, AEROMAP is attempting to produce a robust inversion algorithm for the 
retrieval of aerosol parameters analogous to that used by AERONET but without this source of information. AEROMAP's inversion algorithm will then open the door to 
global aerosol monitoring and characterisation. The inputs to AEROMAP are a small but specific set of satellite measurements. Specifically, daily, full-Earth 
measurements of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) provided by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite instrument in 3 wavelength bands 
(438-448nm, 673-683nm, 862-877nm) spanning the visible spectrum and the near-infrared taken together with a near-infrared measurement of the columnar water vapour, 
are used as well as the best estimate of the absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) at 500nm provided by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite. 
The outputs from AEROMAP are retrievals of over 40 optical and microphysical parameters needed to characterise aerosols. This is accomplished by feeding the 
satellite data into neural networks that have been trained on AERONET "ground-truth" data to learn the relation between the inputs and output parameters. 
The result will be global maps of aerosol optical and microphysical parameters at a resolution of 1o x 1o (50km x 50km) which will be used to monitor and 
classify aerosols as they move daily across the Earth's surface.</p>

<p class="bodytxt">
The main objectives of AEROMAP are to code neural networks to learn the relation between existing satellite inputs and aerosol optical and microphysical parameters 
for different types of aerosol. AEROMAP will use co-located and synchronous ground-truth data to test that the trained networks can extrapolate the aerosol parameters 
retrieved from the satellite inputs at the training data location to new and distant geo-locations. AEROMAP will then generate daily-updated global maps of aerosol 
optical and microphysical parameters and classify aerosol in each pixel by type. AEROMAP will apply the networks to satellite measurements of important extreme aerosol 
events such as desert dust storms, forest fire outbreaks, urban brown cloud episodes, volcanic eruptions and radiation clouds to assess whether or not it is possible to 
monitor and track their spatio-temporal characteristics. By updating the global maps with daily satellite over-pass data, AEROMAP will function as a near-real-time 
monitor of aerosols whose maps and data files will be made publicly-available at the project website/portal. The global aerosol maps will be assessed to develop an 
aerosol impact scale that will be used for the issuing of alerts and early-warning information about aerosol-related hazards.</p>
